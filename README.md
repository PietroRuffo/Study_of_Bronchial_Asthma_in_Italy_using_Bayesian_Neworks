# Study_of_Bronchial_Asthma_in_Italy_using_Bayesian_Neworks
In Italy, it is estimated that every year about nine million people fall ill with respiratory allergies due to the presence of pollen in the air and four million of them seek treatment. People, but especially children, who live in urban areas where the air is polluted are more likely to develop asthma or see the disease worsen. The aim of the analysis is to construct a multinomial Bayesian network to represent the dependence relationships between the variables that influence the onset of this disease in Italy. The use of this methodological tool is proposed both because the problem to be treated is complex and because we want to reason in probabilistic terms on the domain of the problem itself.
